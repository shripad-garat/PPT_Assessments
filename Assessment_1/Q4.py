ğŸ’¡ **Q4.** You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

**Example 1:**
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]

**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 123.

Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
