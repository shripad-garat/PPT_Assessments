ğŸ’¡ **Question 2**

You have a listÂ `arr`Â of all integers in the rangeÂ `[1, n]`Â sorted in a strictly increasing order. Apply the following algorithm onÂ `arr`:

- Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
- Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
- Keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Given the integerÂ `n`, returnÂ *the last number that remains in*Â `arr`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 9
Output: 6
Explanation:
arr = [1, 2,3, 4,5, 6,7, 8,9]
arr = [2,4, 6,8]
arr = [2, 6]
arr = [6]

```
