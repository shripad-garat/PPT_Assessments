ðŸ’¡ **Question 7**
You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.

Count and return *the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations*
