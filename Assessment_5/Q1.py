"""
Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array

You are given a **0-indexed** 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with Â m rows and n columns using **all** the elements from original.

The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (**inclusive**) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (**inclusive**) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return *an* m x n *2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible*.
**Example 1:**

**Input:** original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2

**Output:** [[1,2],[3,4]]

**Explanation:** The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.

The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.

The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.
