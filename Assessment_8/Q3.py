ðŸ’¡ **Question 3**

Given two strings word1 and word2, return *the minimum number of **steps** required to make* word1 *and* word2 *the same*.

In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
