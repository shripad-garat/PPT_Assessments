ðŸ’¡ **Question 1**

Given two strings s and t, *determine if they are isomorphic*.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"

**Output:** true
