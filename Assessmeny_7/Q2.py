ðŸ’¡ **Question 2**

Given a string num which represents an integer, return true *if* num *is a **strobogrammatic number***.

A **strobogrammatic number** is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = "69"

**Output:**

true

## As we can see the only digits which can remain valid after 180 d rotation are 0,1,6,8,9 
## And posible combination would be (0,0)(1,1)(6,9)(8,8)(9,6)
## Lets use two pointer approch and verify if this is the combination they are having
