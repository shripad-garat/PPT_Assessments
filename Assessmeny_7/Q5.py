ðŸ’¡ **Question 5**

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcdefg", k = 2

**Output:**

"bacdfeg"
