ðŸ’¡ **Question 6**

Given two strings s and goal, return true *if and only if* s *can become* goal *after some number of **shifts** on* s.

A **shift** on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

- For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"

**Output:**

true
